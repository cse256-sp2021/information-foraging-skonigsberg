      <h1>Extra Offerings at Our Nursery School</h1>
      <h2>
    Here at Washington University Nursery School we offer three additions to a typical school day:
      </h2>
      <p>
       Summer Camp -- Designed for children ages two and a half to five years, our summer camp program includes a wide range of creative indoor and outdoor activities
      </p>
      <p>
        Bear Tracks: Extended Day -- The Bear Tracks program provides an extension of classroom activities for children who are enrolled in the half-day program. Children who attend Bear Tracks are ready for more than half-day classes but perhaps not full-day schedules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enrichment programs in the following areas -- art, music, Spanish and science.
      </p>
